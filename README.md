## Description
Bookmarking application that utilizes a RESTful Web API on the backend.

## User Stories
1. I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

  * title
  * url link
  * description
  * rating (1-5)

2. I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

3. All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

4. Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

5. I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
  * Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

6. I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
